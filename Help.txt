**Supported Locales**
Covbot currently works in a lot of places. Type /cb list for a complete list, along with their ISO2 codes.

**Admin Commands**
To prevent people from using Covbot for spam these commands are limited to server admins: ```
/cb subscribe (Country) (Time) (Language (Optional))      Subscribes a channel to daily Covbot updates. 
/cb unsubscrine (Country) (Time)                          Unsubscribes a channel from daily Covbot updates. ```
Where:
Country is a country's 2 character ISO code, or Top Level Domain. You can also use "world" for global updates.
Time is the hour in UTC when you want to recieve updates.
Language defaults to a suitable local language, but you can use a 2 charater ISO code to specify a language here. The machine translations are a bit dodgy, so feel free to get in touch with corrections. 
You can also DM these to Covbot if you want daily Covbot updates in your DMs.

/cb update (Country) (Language (Optional))   Posts todays covbot update for the desired locale.
